    <string name="txtCasa">Francisco stands outside his new house. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key. He turns the key in the lock and opens the door. He steps into the living room and looks around. The paint is peeling off the walls. There is no furniture. The house is dirty and smells bad. He tries to open a window but it is broken. The house does not have a kitchen or a bedroom but there is a microwave on the floor on one side of the room. He wonders if it works. The place looks terrible but it is all he can afford. He covers his nose and mouth with his hand and opens the bathroom door. It is in bad condition.</string>
    <string name="txtFamilia">My name is Sangeeta. I am 11. I live in New Delhi, India with my father, mother, two brothers and three sisters. My grandparents also live with us. In India, family is very important. It is common to have grandparents, aunts, uncles and/or cousins living in the same house. My aunts, uncles and cousins also live nearby. We see each other often. My older brother is a computer programmer. Right now, he is in Australia. His company sent him there for one year. We all miss him a lot. We write him letters every week. I want him to come home soon.</string>
    <string name="txtYo">Hello! My name is Ana. I am twenty-five years old. I live in Miami, Florida with my husband and two children. I have one son in kindergarten and one daughter in first grade. They both attend public school. My husband is a mechanic. On weekends, he works at a restaurant as a dishwasher. The restaurant usually gets more customers on weekends, so they need extra people to wash dishes.</string>
